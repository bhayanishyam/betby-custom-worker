Start up your own bookie or sell bookie casino software, whilst relying on big brand names. This works on any bookie software, casino slotmachine or whatever you can get a demo product on your hands for.


# In short
Create cloudflare worker and it's done - make exceptions on any call you want to send to your server first.

It's done widely in industry and practically all are taking sports results from others to better their own or even just use other's. This one takes the whole bookie software included, so not just the results.

It works by just creating a Cloudflare Serverless worker that player connects towards, you can then replace any of the content back and forth between player and the (demo) bookie, including fetching/sending bet data and so on to your own server from the worker before it even reaches player.


Check the "REPLACEMENTS", you can edit any content.
